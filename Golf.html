<p align="center">Golf was another sport that I enjoyed playing when I was small.</p>
<p align="center">I also golfed for all four years throughout High School.</p>
<p align="center">I was on the varsity golf team for my last three years of high school.</p>
<p align="center">I never placed in the individual sections for any tournaments in golf.</p>
<p align="center">My senior year of high school my team placed 2nd in the sectional tournament.</p>
<p align="center">I have not golfed while attending college, but I am considering trying next year.</p>
