<p>I would consider this an adequate summation of the sport.</p>
<p>Golf is a sport that is extremely popular in almost any part of the world</p>
<p>The governing body for golf is the PGA(Professional Golfers Association).</p>
<p>Some people don't consider golf to be much of a sport as it isn't as physically exerting.</p>
<p>Though getting good at golf requires just as much practice as any other sport</p>

<h2 align="center">My Golf History</h2>
<p>Golf was another sport that I enjoyed playing when I was small.</p>
<p>I also golfed for all four years throughout High School.</p>
<p>I was on the varsity golf team for my last three years of high school.</p>
<p>I never placed in the individual sections for any tournaments in golf.</p>
<p>My senior year of high school my team placed 2nd in the sectional tournament.</p>
<p>I have not golfed while attending college, but I am considering trying next year.</p>
