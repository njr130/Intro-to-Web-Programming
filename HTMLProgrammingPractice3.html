<h3 class="text" align="Left"> Linden Street Coffee House</h3>
<p class="text" align="left">The Linden Street Coffee House is a comfortable little place here in Lamoni, Iowa. It is a cozy place for people of all ages to stop in and get a cup of coffee or lunch. Many reviews of this shop say that it has the best coffee along I-35 between Kansas City, Missouri and Des Moines, Iowa.</p>
<h3 class="text" align="left">Graceland University</h3>
<p class="text" align="left"> Graceland University is a privately owned institution for higher education. It is an amazing school with a relatively small population keeping class sizes smaller, and making student faculty interaction easier than you would at a larger school. The campus is beautiful and the staff and students are welcoming and friendly</p>
<h3 class="text" align="left">Lamoni Coliseum</h3>
<p class="text" align="left"> The Coliseum, which is owned by Graceland University, is a local place to be able to view new movie releases without having to travel far from Lamoni. It screens movies three days a week, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, and showings happen two times each of those days. It is a great place to spend a few hours watching the movies you have been waiting for in theater</p>
<h3 class="text" align="left" >Lamoni Livestock Auction</h3>
<p class="text" align="left">Operating for more than 60 years, Lamoni hosts its own livestock auctions here every Thursday. The location has 37 acres of land as well as pens to hold animals and feed and water them. </p>
<h3 class="text" align="left">Lamoni Community Center</h3>
<p class="text" align="left">The Lamoni Community Center is a nice building just off the main street in Lamoni. It can be reserved for gatherings of any kind for families, groups of friends, or whatever you need. It has a kitchen attached to a dining room, as well as two other seperate rooms. If you have a gathering that you want to plan but can't have anyone at you home then the Community Center is a great option to try.</p>
<h2 class="text" align="center">My Review of Lamoni</h2>
<p class="text" align="left">Lamoni is a good small community of people where, like most small towns, people know each other and are generally friendly towards one another. It has some nice restaurants that you can eat at that aren't just fast food. One downside to Lamoni is the lack of things you can do for entertainmen. There is a movie theater and a golf course. Aside from that there isn't much to do around here. Although the town's proximity to the Interstate makes travel to other places that would have more entertainment options easy.</p>
