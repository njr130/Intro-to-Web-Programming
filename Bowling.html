<p align="center">Bowling is a sport that I have enjoyed since I was very young.</p>
<p align="center">During High School I bowled for all four years.</p>
<p align="center">I was able to make the varsity bowling team during my freshman year of high school</p>
<p align="center">For the remaining three years I was also on the varsity team.</p>
<p align="center">The highest placement I have had was 3rd in the Panther Bowling Tournament in Creston, Iowa</p>
<p align="center">I was part of the bowling team during my freshman year at Graceland University as well.</p>
<p align="center">Though the program was cut during that year as well.</p>
