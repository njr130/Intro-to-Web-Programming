<h2 align="center">What is Bowling</h2>
<p>For those that don't know, bowling is a great sport.</p>
<p>It is easy for people of any age to just go and have a good time playing</p>
<p>On the surface bowling probably seems like it is an easy sport.</p>
<p>However it is more complex than what a lot of people might think.</p>
<p>There are many different factures that can change the outcome when you roll your ball.</p>
<p>Your equipment, the conditions of the lane, the temperature/environment of the bowling alley,</p>
<p>and many more things can affect how a bowling ball will react when thrown.</p>
<p>It also requires a lot of practice in order to form a consistent and accurate throw.</p>
<p>Bowling has a profession league called the PBA (Professional Bowlers Association).</p>
<p>It hosts a lot of tournaments for players from all over the world to bowl.</p>
<p>Bowling can get people just as heated up in competition as other sports.</p>
<p>The video below is a funny incident where a player was purposely trying to</p>
<p>cause a distracting sound during other bowlers approaches, and one guy had enough of it.</p>

<h2 align="center">My Bowling History</h2>
<p>Bowling is a sport that I have enjoyed since I was very young.</p>
<p>The highest score I have had in a game is 256</p>
<p>During High School I bowled for all four years.</p>
<p>I was able to make the varsity bowling team during my freshman year of high school</p>
<p>For the remaining three years I was also on the varsity team.</p>
<p>The highest placement I have had was 3rd in the Panther Bowling Tournament in Creston, Iowa</p>
<p>I was part of the bowling team during my freshman year at Graceland University as well.</p>
<p>Though the program was cut during that year as well.</p>
